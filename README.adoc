= Hunspell for VSHN

This project builds a Docker image used to spell check the contents of documents produced at VSHN.

== Exceptions

The file `hunspell_exclude` contains a list of words that are acceptable within VSHN documentation, including the following:

* Network protocols.
* Names of common products.
* Various acronyms.

== Dictionaries

The version of `hunspell` provided in this image _only_ contains dictionaries for the following languages:

* English
* German
* French

NOTE: You can check the list of available dictionaries using the command `docker run --rm --user "$(id -u)" --volume $(pwd):/spell vshn/hunspell:1.7.0 -D`

== Versioning

The Docker images have the same version as the `hunspell` binary contained within.

== Usage

For example, after building the https://handbook.vshn.ch[VSHN Handbook] with the `make html` command, you can run the following command to check the spelling of all HTML files:

`docker run --rm --user "$(id -u)" --volume $(pwd):/spell vshn/hunspell:1.7.0 -d en,vshn -l -H _public/**/*.html`
